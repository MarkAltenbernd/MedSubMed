# Visualizing the MSM Facade #
As a metaphor, I think the image of Horn & Hardart’s Automat is helpful. There is a shiny array of glass, steel, and chrome, with lots of small doors enclosing compartments of goodies that a diner might crave, and by each door a slot for the diner to insert nickels. 

Across the top of the display are labels giving a general idea of the contents of the several compartments in the column below: Pies, Cakes, Sandwiches, and so on. 

The labels correspond to delegate contracts, the individual doors correspond to the delegated functions of those contracts, and the nickels correspond to arguments passed to the functions when they are called. 

Thus the many doors constitute the API of the Automat, shiny, inviting, and easily accessible. 

What goes on behind the façade? Where do the sandwiches, the pies, the hot mac-and-cheese, and the cold ice cream come from? How do they get replenished? What happens when ranges and ovens and sinks and refrigerators and pressure cookers need to be repaired or replaced? What if an interruption in  the supply chain makes running the restaurant a nightmare?  

Who cares? As the developer, the metaphorical diner, I don’t care. I just want quick and easy access to the goodies that the API provides. What goes on behind the wall is immaterial to me as long as I get my goodies when I want them. 

This is the vision of a well-crafted façade.
